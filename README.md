# Fluttershutter ZSH theme

This is mostly for my personal use, as it's a minor modification of the
"wedisagree" theme included in the standard theme pack.

# Install

With oh-my-zsh installed, do the following:

    ln ./fluttershutter.zsh-theme $ZSH/themes/fluttershutter.zsh-theme

Then have the following in your `~/.zshrc`:
